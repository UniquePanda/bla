# basic todos:
- reassign indentifiers
- additional unary operations (e.g. !)
- while loops
- for loops
- arrays
- functions
- objects/structs
- classes
- optimizer for produced asm

# specific ideas/bugs/refactorings/etc:
- remove condensing of multiple plus/minus (e.g. "----5" should throw an error instead of being used as "+5")
- add const as opposed to let?
- require braces around subsequent operators (e.g. "2 + -1" should require "2 + (-1)")?
    - Maybe not :D

# done:
- add line numbers to error messages
- fix calculations with same operator precedence
- +/- unary operators
